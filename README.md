“Educator | Security+ Certified | Data Analytics Learner | Entrepreneur | Guided by Faith & Focus”

# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shiela Dona S. Manlapaz** — a **licensed teacher (Mathematics major)**, **cybersecurity enthusiast**, and **CompTIA Security+ certified (APNIC Foundation – SWITCH 2025)**. I am currently completing the **Cisco Networking Academy Data Analytics Essentials program (DICT-sponsored)**.

I may not consider myself the “best” at math, but I’ve always loved working with numbers — they’ve been a constant part of my life, both in teaching and in data-driven decision-making. I am passionate about **cybersecurity, data analytics, and automation**, and I apply these disciplines in both academia and entrepreneurship. Outside tech, I manage *Don Macchiatos*, a coffee brand where I integrate analytics to improve operations and ROI.

Above all, **my family is my priority, next to God**.

# 🌱 Personal Principles

✨ *“Begin with the End in Mind.”*
I always start with a clear vision of outcomes. This mindset guided me in passing the **CompTIA Security+ certification (APNIC – SWITCH 2025)**, pursuing **Cisco Data Analytics Essentials**, and initiating **real-world automation and forecasting projects**.

📌 *“Focus is the enemy of balance.”*
I believe **focus is more beneficial than balance**. Focus means knowing **who and what will be our priority**, removing unnecessary clutter, and letting that clarity guide decisions — in teaching, entrepreneurship, and family life.

And in this journey, I’ve seen how **being focused has invited God’s provision and blessing** into my life. Heaven has supported me through opportunities, mentors, and programs like **APNIC SWITCH 2025 and DICT Cisco training**. I am truly **grateful and blessed** for every step He has aligned for me.

As a **faculty member**, I design teaching for **long-term growth of students**, not just short-term grades.
As an **entrepreneur**, I set measurable goals for **sustainability and ROI**, ensuring every move aligns with my mission to serve my **community and family with excellence**.

This reminds me to align my **skills, passions, and experiences** with service — whether in **technology, teaching, or entrepreneurship**.
